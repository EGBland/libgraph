# libliz
Some little C libraries, written for fun and for utility in some other projects.

## To compile
Enter one of the directories (e.g. `libgraph`) and do `make`. The header files are in `include` and the resultant library object file is the `.a` file, e.g. `libgraph.a`.

## libgraph
Undirected graph library. Currently writing a minimum spanning tree function. Will add geodesic metric and related node properties (central/peripheral nodes, diameter, etc).

## libstack
A potentially na√Øve C implementation of a stack.
